A scaffold for REST API

## Getting started

First, install [Yeoman](http://yeoman.io) and generator-digga using [npm](https://www.npmjs.com/) (we assume you have pre-installed [node.js](https://nodejs.org/)).

```bash
npm install -g yo
npm install -g generator-digga
```

Then generate your new project:

```bash
yo digga
```

"Yo Digga" is the Northern German way to say "Hi bro". The word is derived from the German word Dicker, which, in this context, means close friend.
